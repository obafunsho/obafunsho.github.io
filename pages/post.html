                <section class="post__content">
                    <p>April seriously wondered about her sleeping partner choices.</p>
                    <p>
                        She looked at her bed and what a mess it had become. <br />
                        How did she get to the point in her life where she had two dogs, three cats, and a raccoon
                        sleeping with her every night?
                    </p>
                    <h2>Another story</h2>
                    <p>They had no proof. He knew that they knew he had done it but they didn't have any proof. It was a
                        huge distinction and it was the difference between him keeping his freedom or being locked away
                        for decades.</p>
                    <p>They continued to question him, probing him for information that they could use against him or
                        find the proof they needed to put him away.</p>
                    <p>He smiled and continued to block their every inquiry by feigning his innocence for a crime they
                        all knew he committed.</p>
                    <h2>Just another story</h2>
                    <p>Ten more steps. If he could take ten more steps it would be over, but his legs wouldn't move. He
                        tried to will them to work, but they wouldn't listen to his brain. Ten more steps and it would
                        be over but it didn't appear he would be able to do it.</p>
                    <p>There were only two ways to get out of this mess if they all worked together. The problem was
                        that neither was all that appealing. One would likely cause everyone a huge amount of physical
                        pain while the other would likely end up with everyone in jail.</p>
                    <p>In Sam's mind, there was only one thing to do. He threw everyone else under the bus and he
                        secretly sprinted away leaving the others to take the fall without him.</p>
                    <h3>Testing H3 and other elements</h3>
                    <p>As a true geek, I decided to study all. I took a course on digital marketing, then another on
                        financial analysis. Watched countless <a href="#">Youtube videos on UI and motion design</a> and
                        got a certification. I even took courses on drawing and travel photography. Wow!</p>
                    <p>Here is an abbreviation for <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr></p>
                    <p>Here is an ordered list:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Jealous</strong> - Labrinth</li>
                        <li><strong>Dandelion</strong> - Ruth B.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stand Up</strong> (from Harriet) - Cynthia Erivo</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>What happened to the type of the class that <code>this.MdiChildren</code> and the text is longer
                        than the Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Veritatis quis, in ducimus at,
                        numquam recusandae ea sunt fuga accusamus officiis reprehenderit <code>public class</code>
                        keyword.</p>
                    <p>And here is an unordered list lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python - Data Analysis</li>
                        <li>JavaScript - Web Development</li>
                        <li>.NET- Windows native applications</li>
                        <li>PHP - Web Development</li>
                        <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Repellendus minus sequi, pariatur
                            cumque optio? Ipsa sint, quis ex reiciendis nemo animi natus.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        What would happen if I put the code like this <em><code>this.MdiChildren.Length</code></em>
                    </p>
                    <p>And a <a href="#">link in the post</a>?</p>
